# EveMarketScanner
This is a remake of a quick script I wrote for a game called Eve Online.
It takes items from a predefined excel sheet and scans the in-game market
for these items. It then parses the market data and returns the items
deemed to be most profitable.

 ***INSERT EXACT METHOD***

This script makes 109 URL queries to the sites it gathers data from.
It takes a few minutes to run so go grab some coffee or something.
You can easily limit the number of URL queries made by changing queryLimit
in Driver.py
